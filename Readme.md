# Graphql and React working together with MongoDB

This project was made following a tutorial from [The net ninja][the net ninja] on learning [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) from an absolute to becoming a ninja.

The project really goes deep into some concepts in learning of the Graphql querying language such as:

- Learning to write grapql [queries and mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)
- learning to use [express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql) as a middleware on express to tap into the request and generally just make it work
- learning to also use [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to work with **[mongodb](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)** in order to create a database.
